This paper presents an **empirical analysis of oracle-based Bayesian persuasion**, extending the theoretical framework proposed by Harris et al. (2024). I conducted two computational experiments to examine how different receiver belief distributions influence optimal messaging policies and sender utility.  

- **Experiment 1**: Validates the theoretical results using **uniformly distributed** receiver beliefs.  
- **Experiment 2**: Investigates the effects of **polarized belief distributions**, revealing that polarization can lead to higher sender utility (**0.700 vs. 0.600**).  

Through rigorous numerical simulations, my findings provide empirical support for the theoretical framework while uncovering new insights into the relationship between belief distribution characteristics and optimal persuasion strategies.
